Q2 a) The key type absolutely can not be AccountNo*, as it would be looked up with pointer comparison, and it is very unlikely that we will have the same pointer at index time. AccountNo& shouldn't be used because we are creating the object on the stack, and a reference to things no-longer on the stack isn't a great idea.

Q2 b) If the value were Account, every time we accessed this map we would get a new copy of the Account. Account& is discluded for the same reason AccountNo& is above, and so we are left with Account*.
