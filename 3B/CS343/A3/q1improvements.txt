Some improvements that would likely have a great effect on performance would
be giving the hashing responsibility to the mappers and allowing them to push
the resulting KeyValues to the appropriate reducer, rather than relying on the
reducers to always poll.

Furthermore, not requiring the SortMappers to make several passes of the input
streams (which makes the algorithm O(n^2)) would be a boon.
