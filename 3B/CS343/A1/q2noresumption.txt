My algorithm for transforming resumption to fixup routines was to
pass a functor representing the currently scoped fixup routine to
each call of f() and g(). Furthermore, the fixup functors themselves
took a reference to the currently scoped fixup routine (to deal
with the case in which a resume is called from a resumption handler).
